## 3 Cases to know:

### The `&` Operator:

The `&` before a variable means that we are referecing the variable's **memory address**

### The `*` Operator:

The `*` can go in front of a type or a variable.

_In front of a type_ and thte `*` means that the `*` becomes a part of that type declaration.

_In front of a variable_ and that variable HOLDS the **memory address** of that object. Basically it grabs the stuff that the pointer `*` was referencing.
