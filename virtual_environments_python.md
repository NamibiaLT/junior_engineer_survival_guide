### Installing a Virtual environment with pip
1) `pip install pipenv` __installs pip's virtual environment__
2) `pipenv shell` __to go into your virtual environment shell__
    * Wherever you see a note to a `pip install` instruction, make sure you're in your virtual environment first.
3) to leave virtual environment type `exit` and Voila!, you are out of the virtual environment
