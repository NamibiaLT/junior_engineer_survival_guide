## Starting at the basics of computer science: A language called C

### A simple Hello, Workd:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world");
}
```

* In C the `f` in `printf` stands for "formatted". 
* The above code is saying "print formatted text `Hello, world'"
* `stdio.h` is where we store our functions, and we tell the computer to look there for the functions that we are calling.
